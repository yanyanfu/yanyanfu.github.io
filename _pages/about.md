Yanfu Yan is a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in computer science at William & Mary, where she is advised by [Prof. Denys Poshyvanyk](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~denys/). Her primary research interests lie in software engineering, focusing on areas such as software evolution and maintenance, program comprehension, deep learning for software engineering (DL4SE), and mobile app development. She holds a master's degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and a bachelor's degree from Xiamen University.

<!-- I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/?svr=web){:target="_blank"} at the [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

I lead the [**S**oftware **E**volution and **A**nalysis (**SEA**)](lab/) Lab, which conducts research in software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, code refactoring, code quality, code documentation, developer's productivity, and text analysis applied to software engineering (SE).

While my research spans multiple SE topics, my **current research focus** is on:
1. automating bug reporting, triage, and resolution (*aka* automate bug report management)
2. recovering and managing the knowledge produced by stakeholders in software artifacts to improve software quality and code change tasks (e.g., code refactoring)
3. automating and managing the software supply chain (emphasis on licensing and software evolution)

My research employs **empirical methods**, analyzes/leverages **different software artifacts** (software bug reports, source code, online discussions, etc.), and builds on **creating, adapting, and integrating techniques** based on program analysis, software repository mining (MSR), information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and machine/deep learning (ML/DL).

Take a look at my [publications](publications/) to know more about my research.

**Education**: I got my Ph.D. in Software Engineering (SE) from [The University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2019, under the advice of Dr. [Andrian Marcus](http://www.utdallas.edu/~amarcus/){:target="_blank"}, and my B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in Systems Engineering and Computing from [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://bogota.unal.edu.co/){:target="_blank"} in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia.
