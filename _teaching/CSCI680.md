**Description**

Software maintenance and evolution are essential activities in the development of a software system. They account for more than half of the resources invested in a project. To reduce such costs, software stakeholders can adopt different strategies. 

In this course, students will be introduced to principles and techniques of software maintenance and evolution. The course will cover well-established techniques and recent advances in the following topics:
* Software change management
* Software quality measurement
* Software quality assurance
* Mining of software repositories
* Software refactoring
* Defect prediction
* Defect management

The course will mainly include lectures given by the instructor. The students will complete assignments related to the course topics, read and make presentations of a few research papers, and complete a term project. The students are expected to actively participate in class discussions.
